## Project Description

This project is a colour flipper, it is a webpage with a button where when pressed changes the background colour of the page to a random colour.

The reason for this project was to practise using javascript in relation with html and css, this so i can learn how websites are built and also their inner workings. Another reason was to learn basic DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation, which i want to bring into future projects. 

When programming this project there was only one problem with the code, this was the background not changing to certain colours that i programed it to display. this turned out to be the colours not being named in css like this `background:color:blue`, the fix i done for this was changing it colours in the JavaScript code to hex codes for them instead. i had one none code problem with the design however, this was down more to me being a perfectsionist. because i doubt my design skills very badly. 

## How to Use the Project

1. **Open the HTML File In Browser**

    * Open the `index.html` in your web browser, to launch the Colour Flipper.

2. **Interact With The Button**

   * Click the "Click Me" button to change the background colour randomly.
   * The current background color's name or code will be displayed beside the pages background at the top.

3. **How To Understand The Display**

    * The colour name is shown inside a styled box at the center of the page.
