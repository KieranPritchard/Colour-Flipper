# Colour Flipper

## Project Description

This project is a colour flipper, it is a webpage with a button where when pressed changes the background colour of the page to a random colour.

The reason for this project was to practise using javascript in relation with html and css, this so i can learn how websites are built and also their inner workings. Another reason was to learn basic DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation, which i want to bring into future projects. 

When programming this project there was only one problem with the code, this was the background not changing to certain colours that i programed it to display. this turned out to be the colours not being named in css like this `background:color:blue`, the fix i done for this was changing it colours in the JavaScript code to hex codes for them instead. i had one none code problem with the design however, this was down more to me being a perfectsionist. because i doubt my design skills very badly.
