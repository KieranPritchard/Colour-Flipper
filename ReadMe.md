## Project Description
### Objective:
To practice using Javascript in relation with HTML and CSS. To also practice manipulating the DOM, Document Object Model.
### Features:
* Colours change to another at random, on click of the button.
* Very simple interface.
* Demonstrates basic knowledge of Javascript and Document Object Model.
### Tools and Languages:
* **Languages:** HTML, CSS, & Javascript
* **Tools:** VS Code & git.
### Challenges Faced:
There was only one problem with the code being it wasn't updating when the button was clicked, this was because the javascript was applying the `background-color` style with a typo. the typo made it like this: `background-colour` however, this was due to the U.K spelling of it which is where I live.  On the other hand, I had a problem with styling it. But that was down more to perfectionism.
### Outcome:
Successfully created a project that practises what was laid out in the objective, also managed to practise using javascript to build a project.
